      <Header>When was it created?</Header>
      <Content>
        Slackline was created in the 1980s by rock climbers in Yosemite Valley, California. They used to set up a line between two trees and walk on it to relax and have fun. 
        Since then, the sport has evolved and become popular worldwide. 
        Today, you can find slackline parks in many cities and slackline competitions in different countries.

      <Header>Where can I by a slackline?</Header>
      <Content>
        Slacklines aren't as easy to find as other sports equipment, but you can buy them online or at outdoor sports stores.
        Decathlon has it in a few cities, but you can also find it on Amazon, Mercado Livre, and other online stores.
        If you can find one in OLX, you can also try to buy a used one, just be sure that the equipment is in good condition. <br/>
